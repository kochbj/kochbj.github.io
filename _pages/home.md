# Hello!
I'm Bernie. You can check out my résumé/CV to learn a bit about me. I'm mostly using this site to share things I've been working on. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat!

**03/22/2022:** I'm excited to be interning on the ML team at Spotify Research this summer.

**03/22/2022:** Jacob Foster and I were invited to speak at Apple University about "[Reduced, Reused, and Recycled: The Life of a Benchmark in Machine Learning Research](https://openreview.net/forum?id=zNQBIBKJRkd)".

**01/01/2022:** I am teaching an "Intro to Computational Social Science" course at Colby College for a month. I'm a little afraid of the cold, but the rest of the experience should be great!

**11/30/2021:** "[Reduced, Reused, and Recycled: The Life of a Benchmark in Machine Learning Research](https://openreview.net/forum?id=zNQBIBKJRkd)" with Emily Denton, Alex Hanna, and my advisor Jacob Foster won an award for ["Best Paper"](https://blog.neurips.cc/2021/11/30/announcing-the-neurips-2021-award-recipients/?s=09) in the Datasets and Benchmarks Track at NeurIPS 2021. This was one of nine paper awards given at the whole conference. I'm frankly shocked (and delighted) that it resonated so strongly with people!
